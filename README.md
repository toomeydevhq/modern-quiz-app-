# Quiz App

A web-based trivia quiz application that challenges users with questions across three categories: General Knowledge, Science, and History. The app features a clean, responsive interface, a 30-second timer per question, tailored hints, a review system, dark/light mode, sound effects, and confetti for high scores. Questions are stored in a local `questions.json` file, with 30 questions per category, randomly selecting 10 per quiz for variety.

## Features

- **Multiple Categories**: Choose from General Knowledge, Science, or History.
- **Randomized Questions**: Each quiz randomly selects 10 questions from a pool of 30 per category, ensuring variety.
- **Tailored Hints**: Every question includes a specific, non-revealing hint (e.g., "This city is known as the 'City of Light'." for Paris).
- **Timer**: 30 seconds per question, with a warning sound and visual cue in the last 5 seconds.
- **Scoring & Review**: Tracks correct/incorrect answers, displays a percentage score, and offers a detailed review with questions, answers, and hints.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between themes, saved in `localStorage`.
- **Sound Effects**: Optional sounds for correct/incorrect answers and timer warnings, toggleable and saved in `localStorage`.
- **Confetti Celebration**: Triggered for scores of 80% or higher.
- **Local Data**: Uses a `questions.json` file for questions, eliminating external API dependencies.
